PREMISE
--------------------------------
You as a magical artist who is capable of breathing life into paintings with ink. While you were lounging in your tower-castle your neighbor steals a magical pen from you. With the power of the magical pen, the neighbor has gained the ability to form an army of his own. To defend your home and take back your pen, you must defend your tower-castle and beat your neighbor at his own game.
--------------------------------

WIN/LOSE CONDITION 
--------------------------------
Winning requires the player to defeat the opponent’s tower-castle and losing requires the opponent to destroy the player’s tower-castle.
--------------------------------

CONTROLS
--------------------------------
	Mouse: Interact
	Arrow Buttons: Pan Camera
	Scroll Wheel: Zoom In/Out
--------------------------------
	
INKCOME©
--------------------------------
The inkcome© aspect of the game will consist of a time-based basic income of ink. Increasing the inkcome© amount will be based on the spawn count of the player’s army. Each creature unit will have an inkcome© attribute which will be added to the base income. Every set amount of time, i.e. 15 seconds, the inkwell will be added by the inkcome© amount the player currently has. This feature encourages the player to spawn creatures while defending their base at the same time. Users can spend ink to purchase towers. Once purchased, the towers can be placed wherever the user desires. This allows the user to form mazes and other designs in order to impede the enemy’s movement. There are two type of upgrades for towers. The first is the base upgrade which raises the overall stats of the tower and unlocks further features. The other upgrade allows ganting attributes to the tower through modifiers.
--------------------------------
	
TOWERS 
--------------------------------
Towers are buildings used to defend against Creatures. There is a varied number of base towers to select from. Each base tower has their own unique upgrade tree structure. Towers shoot projectiles which have effects depending on the modifiers the tower has. They can be upgraded to become more powerful at the cost of ink. Detailed information such as costs, damages, and special attributes are to be developed and fined tuned at a later date.
All Highest Tier towers grant the ability to summon special units.

MODIFIERS
--------------------------------
Modifiers are a type of attribute or effect that can be applied to both creatures and towers. Certain modifiers only work for either towers or creatures, but many can be applied to both. An enemy that has an elemental modifier (like fire or water) will become resistant to towers that have the same modifier. The number of modifiers is dependent on the level of the tower. Level 1 towers can’t have a modifier, level 2 towers can have one, etc... Creatures come preloaded with a modifier.
